Description: The Stochastic Dominance (SD) is the classical way of comparing two
    random prospects, using their distribution functions. Almost Stochastic
    Dominance (ASD) has also been developed to cover the SD failures due to 
    the extreme utility functions. This package focuses on classical and heuristic methods
    for testing the first and second SD and ASD methods given the probability mass
    function (PMF) of the random prospects. The goal is to apply these methods
    easily, efficiently, and effectively on real-world datasets. For more
    details see Hanoch and Levy (1969) <doi:10.2307/2296431>, Leshno and Levy
    (2002) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1074.169>, and Tzeng et al. (2012)
