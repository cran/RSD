\title{Compares prospects based on AFSD}
\usage{
afsd.test(sd.obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{sd.obj}{StochasticDominance object.}
}
\value{
A list, including all the calculation details.
}
\description{
It compares two prospects using AFSD criteria, that is the prospect having
the minimum violation area from a classic FSD.
}
\details{
The returned list has six elements: `winner` indicates the dominant prospect
index. It will be zero if neither dominates the other. `epsilon` is the ratio
of violated area to the total area between the CDFs. `area` is a vector, where
the values show the area between the CDFs correspond to each segment.
`total.area` is the total area between the CDFs. `positive.area` is the
amount of area where the `area` vector is positive, meaning the `cdf1` is
larger than `cdf2`. `negative.area` is like `positive.area` for negative
values.
